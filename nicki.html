    <p>Various media outlets, such as Billboard, Time, NME, Rolling Stone, NBC News and Cosmopolitan, have referred to Minaj as the "Queen of Rap" and The New York Times, The Washington Post, NPR, and The Los Angeles Times have referred to her as the "Queen of Hip Hop".[424][425] Several media outlets, including The New York Times, Evening Standard, and Nylon, have also called her one of the most influential rappers.[426] Minaj was ranked as the tenth greatest rapper of all time on Billboard and Vibe's list of the 50 greatest rappers (2023).[9] In 2024, Billboard named her the "hottest female rapper" and stated that she "remains at the apex of the rap mountain 15 years after the release of her breakout mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty".[427]

        In 2012, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj "the most influential female rapper of all time", and in 2015 Vanessa Grigoriadis from its magazine called her "the world's biggest female rap superstar".[315][395] In Evening Standard, Jochan Embley called her one of the most influential rap artists of all time, saying that "Everything she does is bold, fearless and distinct – whether that be her eye-popping stage attire or her expertly delivered lyrics, which stare gender and race dead in the eye."[428] Zoe Johnson from XXL called her "one of the most versatile MCs" and that she has "made millions off upbeat pop hits and traditional hip-hop sounds that cater to both her femininity and her assertive side".[330]
        
        For NPR Music, Sowmya Krishnamurthy noted that Minaj has portrayed "the quirky, life-size Barbie, glamorous vixen and girl-next-door", arguing that she "changed the landscape for artists in hip-hop for the past decade" with said alter egos.[429] In 2017, Patrik Sandberg of Dazed argued that Minaj has "surpassed every other female hip hop artist to become the most successful in history" in 2017.[430] In 2020, Nick Soulsby of PopMatters called her the "best female rapper and the best rapper of the past ten years – no gender preposition required."[431] Glamour included Minaj in their list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture.[432]
        
        In XXL, Madeline Roth commented that Minaj "has helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style".[330] She has influenced several artists, including Tinashe,[433] Cher Lloyd,[434] Cupcakke,[435] Billie Eilish,[436] Lil Nas X,[437] Ms Banks,[438] Asian Doll,[439] Doja Cat,[440] Megan Thee Stallion,[441] Latto,[442] Shenseea,[443] BIA,[444] Lakeyah,[445] Luísa Sonza,[446] Coi Leray,[447] Maliibu Miitch,[448] City Girls,[449] Baby Tate,[450] Ice Spice,[451] Rico Nasty,[452] Flo Milli,[453] Ivorian Doll,[454] Angel Haze,[455] Rubi Rose, and Saweetie.[456] Billboard credited her for bringing female rap back to the mainstream in the U.S.[457] With over 140 features, the magazine has called Minaj a "rap and pop icon" adding that "she's been one of popular music's most reliable guest performers, notching dozens of chart hits as a supporting presence on other artists' singles."[458] Minaj has been credited by Complex for being able to "take a simple song and turn it into a smash hit just because she's featured on it."[459] In 2012, Caramanica in The New York Times said that:
        
        Minaj "became a nimble, evocative rapper. She became an intricate lyricist. She became a thoughtful singer. She became a risky performer. She invented new personae. More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations ... with no one around to compare herself to, or for others to compare her to, she became her own watermark."[460]
        In 2014, NPR's Erik Nielson said that Minaj's "success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists".[461] Nylon writer, Demicia Inman, also credited Minaj for her influence which "stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium", also going on to say that Minaj "battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound" thus impacting her career. Complex also commented that, "From her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely... [she] doesn't need anything but her art to speak for itself".[462][463] Michael Saponara of Billboard wrote that Minaj "reaffirmed living legend status" by "hitting the road for the Pink Friday 2 World Tour"—which became the highest-grossing tour by a female rapper—and proved herself as rap's "centrifugal female force".[427]
